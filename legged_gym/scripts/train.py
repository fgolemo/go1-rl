# Summary training
# logs/flat_go1/Jan12_11-17-01_ : training with every parameters default
# logs/flat_go1/Jan12_15-38-30_ : train with hip_reduction_scale added in legged_robot.py - no big changes 
# Keep hip reduction scale from this point
# logs/flat_go1_act_net/Jan12_16-23-54_: train with actuator network from walk-these-ways - works well
# Only use actuator net now
# logs/flat_go1_act_net/Jan15_10-47-31_: train with 48 observations as it represents the reality - simulations is good
# logs/flat_go1_act_net/Jan16_18-51-39_: removed base lin vel and projected gravity - robot in a crouched position but it's still walking
